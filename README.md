# Shiny-Runs

This project contains the ideas and design for a discarded solution for
IT automation (remote scripting execution).

The solucion is composed of:

- a dashboard front end (with administration and users zones)
- a flow engine for execution orchestration
- a configuration management service
- agents for remote execution
- some kind of scripting online editor
- and a logging registry or storage

## Introduction

P.S. The project name ('shiny-runs') was proposed by the GitHub's random
project generator; it's not planned.
